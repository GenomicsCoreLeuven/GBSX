Genotyping by Sequencing is an emerging technology for cost effective variant 
discovery and genotyping. However, current analysis tools do not fulfill all 
experimental design and analysis needs.  
  
GBSX is a package of tools to first aid in experimental design, including choice 
of enzymes and barcode design. Secondly, it provides a first analysis step to 
demultiplex samples using in-line barcodes, providing fastq files that can 
easily be plugged into existing variant analysis pipelines.
