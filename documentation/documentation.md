## Help

Genotyping By Sequencing demultipleXing toolkit (GBSX) is a toolkit with an 
inline barcode demultiplexer for usage in the analysis of single read or 
paired-end genotyping by sequence (GBS) data, a barcode generator, a barcode 
discovery tool, and a restriction enzyme predictor. GBSX can easily be 
incorperated as a preceding analysis step for already deployed SNP pipelines.
